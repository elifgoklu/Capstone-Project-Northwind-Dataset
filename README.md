# Northwind Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the Northwind dataset using SQL and Python. The goal is to examine various aspects of the dataset, such as sales performance, customer behavior, product stock levels, and geographic trends. The analysis provides valuable insights to improve business decisions across multiple areas.

## SQL Analysis
The SQL portion of the project covers several key analyses:

- **General Sales Analysis**: Tracking total sales revenue, total orders, and average discounts to assess overall performance.
- **Product & Category Analysis**: Evaluating product price trends, identifying cross-selling opportunities, and analyzing category-based sales trends.
- **Customer Analysis**: Investigating customer revenue distribution, segmenting customers by spending, and determining geographic hotspots for revenue.
- **Employee Performance Analysis**: Measuring sales representatives' performance based on the number of orders, revenue generated, and the customer segments they serve.
- **Logistics & Delivery Analysis**: Analyzing delivery times, shipping costs, and performance of shipping companies.

## Python Analysis
The Python section complements the SQL analysis by focusing on specific aspects such as:

- **Stock Level Analysis**: Monitoring product stock levels, identifying products with insufficient stock, and calculating the necessary reorder quantities.
- **Geographic Sales Insights**: Further analyzing sales data based on country-specific trends, especially focusing on shipping times and costs.
